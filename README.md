# üö¶ Traffic Challan Management System

A web-based application to digitize issuing and managing traffic challans, enhancing transparency and efficiency for both police officers and drivers.

---

## üìñ Project Overview
Traffic challans are often managed manually, which can lead to delays, errors, and lack of transparency. This system provides:
- **Police login** to issue and manage challans.
- **Driver login** to view pending challans.
- A **centralized database** to securely store challan data.

---

## üèó System Workflow
1. **Police** log in, issue, and update challan status.
2. **Drivers** log in to view challans and check payment status.
3. **SQLite database** (`traffic.db`) handles storage of all records.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Police Dashboard:** Issue challans with driver and vehicle details.
- **Driver Dashboard:** View active and past challans.
- **Database Integration:** Lightweight, secure record keeping via SQLite.
- **User Authentication:** Secure logins for police and drivers.
- **Responsive UI:** Accessible on both desktop and mobile.
